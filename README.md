This repo contains an example of using Polars to analyze LODES data from the US Census. It's intended for data scientists curious about switching from Pandas to Polars.

- A long-form introduction to Polars for data scientists and managers of data scientists can be found in the `polars_intro.md` document.
- The demonstration code can be found in the `polars_demo` module.
- You can see this code in action in the `industry_concentration.ipynb` notebook.
- The `download_lodes_data.sh` shell script contains code to batch download LODES data, as the Census makes the files available state-by-state.
